DAY 0 --repo created and initial problems added.
Goal: 30 advanced problems in Python and SQL.

DAY 1 -- Python Logic + SQL Queries.
- Started with logic-focused Python practice: built a transaction summary function to separate income and expenses.
- Used dictionaries and learned to print formatted results using f-strings.
- Created SQL tables (`sales`, `custmer`) and practiced `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and aggregate functions.
- Faced issues with query structure — learned that aliases and aggregates must be used carefully.
- Goal for Day 2: Build a data analysis challenge combining both — clean data in Python, analyze results with SQL.
